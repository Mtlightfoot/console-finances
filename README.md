# Console-Finances

## Description

My motivation for this project was to use JavaScript to figure out a real-world situation using if statements and for loops to create code to analyse the financial records of a company that are kept in an array. This webpage is where I have built the algorithm to work out various things off financial data such as total months, the net amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, the average in changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period and also the greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses showing the date and amount. This solves a problem of having to manually work out the analytics of the financial records.
